    "description": "On December 7th, 1941, Japan's surprise military attack on the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii not only was the catalyst for the United States entering World War II, but also had a drastic effect on the lives of Japanese immigrants and Japanese-Americans living in the United States. This exhibit looks at the experiences of the Japanese communities in and around Idaho during World War II.",
